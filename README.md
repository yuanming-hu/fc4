**Change log:**
- April 25, 2018: **Released network definition scripts and training instructions**. TODO:
   - update `config.py` for reproducing benchmark numbers.
   - Upgrade `python` version from `2.7` to `3.5+`. **Please use python 2.7 for now.**
   - Remove internal project code and release all the other scripts.
   - Retrain on datasets to get a tensorflow `1.7` compatible pretrained model.
- April 15, 2018: Started preparing for code release.

# FAQ
## **Color Constancy and Datasets**

a) **Where to get the datasets?**
 - *Shi's Re-processing of Gehler's Raw Dataset*: [here](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~colour/data/shi_gehler/)
 - *NUS-8 Camera Dataset*: [here](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~whitebal/illuminant/illuminant.html)

**(The following two sub-questions are FAQs before I release the code - now the script will take care of these details and you don't need to worry unless out of curisity.)**

b) **The input images look purely black. What's happening?**

The input photos from the ColorChecker dataset are 16-bit `png` files and some image viewer may not support them, as `png`s are typically 8-bit. 
Also, since these photos are linear (RAW sensor activations) and modern displays have a `2.2` gamma value (instead of linear gamma), they will appear even darker when displayed. An exposure correction is also necessary.

c) **I corrected the gamma. Now most images appear green. Is there anything wrong?**

It's common that RAW images appear green. One possible cause is that the color filters of digital cameras may have a stronger activation on the green channel.

d) **What can be done to improve the datasets?**

 - **(More data for deep learning)** The amount of data is relatively small for deep learning.
 - **(More data for accurate comparison)** With only 568 images, the test noise is huge. When three-fold cross-validation is used, if a single test image raises its error from 1 degree to 18 degrees (which is common), it will result in ~0.1 degree average angular error increase. Another issue about the small amount of data is that, the gap between validation set and test set can still be very large. As a result, you may find early stopping on the validation set may not result in a pleasant error on the test set. 
 - **(Validation set)** The (historical) three-fold cross-validation splits do not actually have validation sets. This means people have to tweak hyper-parameters based on the test set. This may not be a serious issue for traditional statistics-based approaches since not many parameters need to be tuned, but the risk of overfitting is becoming higher and higher when the model goes deeper and deeper!
 - **(Quality)** In some images, there are actually more than one light sources in the scene. The illumination difference may be as large as 10 degrees. Since we already achieve < 2 degrees of estimation error, further reducing this number may not provide a significant evidence for algorithm comparison.

Finally, [**The Cube dataset**](http://ipg.fer.hr/ipg/resources/color_constancy#) can be useful for future research!

## FC<sup>4</sup> Training and Testing

a) **Installation**
 
 Please use python2 for now. All dependencies can be installed via `pip`:
 ```
 sudo python2 -m pip install opencv-python tensorflow-gpu scipy
 ```

b) **Data Pre-processing**

[*Shi's Re-processing of Gehler's Raw Dataset*:](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~colour/data/shi_gehler/)
 - Download the 4 zip files from the website
 - Extract the `png` images into `fc4/data/gehler/images/`, without creating subfolders.
 - `python dataset.py`, and wait for it to finish
 - `python show_patches.py` to view **data-augmented** patches. Press any key to see the next patch. You can use this data provider to train your own network.

c) **Model Training**
 - First, make sure you have preprocessed the data.
 - `python fc4.py train example`, and wait for it to finish. The model will be located at `models/fc4/example/`. `example` here is the model name and you can change it to any other suitable identifier.
 - Note that there are three folds and you need to modify Ln 99 of `config.py` to `FOLD = 1` or `FOLD = 2` for other two folds.

d) **Visualize Confidence Maps**
 You can look at how the confidence map evolves at the folders `models/fc4/example/testXXXXsummaries_0.500000`.

e) **Pretrained models?**

  To get a pretrained model, please download [**Pretrained model on the ColorChecker Dataset**](https://github.com/yuanming-hu/fc4/releases/download/pretrained/pretrained_colorchecker_fold1and2.zip), and put the three files in folder `pretrained`
 - This model is trained on **fold 1 and fold 2**. It should be tested on **fold 0**. More models coming soon.
 
f) **How to make inference on images based on trained model?**
 - Test on the ColorChecker dataset (make sure you have preprocessed it):
 ```
  python2 fc4.py test tmp/colorchecker_fold1and2.ckpt -1 g0
 ```
 - Test on other images: TODO
